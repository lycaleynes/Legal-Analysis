<h1>Legal Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project addresses the laws, regulations, authorities, and directives that inform the development of operational policies, best practices, and training. These standards assure legal compliance and minimize internal and external threats.</p>

<p>In this task, I analyzed legal constraints and liability concerns that threaten information security within the given organization and developed disaster recovery plans to ensure business continuity.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

Review the attached “TechFite Case Study” for information on the company being investigated. All responses are based on this scenario.

<h2>CFAA and ECPA</h2>

<p>In the case study, the Business Intelligence (BI) Unit of TechFite gained unauthorized access to financial and executive documents from other departments by using dummy accounts. Since these systems were connected to the internet for business operations, they qualify as "protected computers" under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). This activity, which involved unauthorized access to internal systems, constitutes a violation of the CFAA.</p>

<p></p>The BI Unit also violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). An investigation revealed the use of the Metasploit tool on their devices to scan networks of external companies without permission. Senior analysts Sarah Miller, Megan Rogers, and Jack Hudson led these activities, intercepting communications from other companies for intelligence purposes. This unauthorized interception and use of communications breaches the ECPA.</p>

<h2>Three Laws</h2>

<p>TechFite's negligence in monitoring and controlling user access facilitated the criminal activity associated with the ECPA violation. Employees could use Metasploit without detection by failing to enforce proper user access controls and network monitoring. This negligence in internal oversight and network security allowed the BI Unit to unlawfully intercept other companies' networks, justifying legal action under the ECPA. The failure to enforce cybersecurity policies directly led to the penetration and scanning of other companies' networks, which became the basis for the violation of ECPA.</p>

<p>Similarly, TechFite's negligence regarding its user account management contributed to the violation of the CFAA. The BI Unit did not follow the principle of least privilege, resulting in excessive permissions for employees. This negligent oversight facilitated unauthorized access to internal financial and legal documents using dummy accounts, resulting in a violation of the CFAA. Legal action is justified based on the company's failure to implement proper access control mechanisms, directly enabling criminal activity.</p>

<p>Lastly, TechFite's failure to maintain accurate financial audits and proper internal controls violated the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). The creation of dummy corporations, orchestrated by Carl Jaspers and his associate Yu Lee, inflated TechFite's sales figures without proper scrutiny or auditing. The negligence in financial oversight allowed this fraudulent activity to occur, leading to non-compliance with SOX regulations. Legal action is justified based on the company's failure to implement adequate financial controls, which allowed for the manipulation of financial reports.</p>

<h2>Duty of Due Care</h2>

<p>Carl Jaspers, as head of the Applications Division, failed to enforce the principle of segregation of duties within the Business Intelligence (BI) Unit. This failure resulted in employees having full administrative access to other departments’ data, such as legal and financial records. The absence of this fundamental security practice constitutes a breach of the duty of due care, as the lack of segregation enabled unauthorized access to sensitive information. This failure exposed TechFite to legal risks due to improper access management and poor internal controls.</p>

<p>Nadia Johnson, the IT Security Analyst for TechFite, also demonstrated a lack of due care by failing to audit user accounts and monitor internal network activity. Her failure to enforce data loss prevention (DLP) policies and regularly review account privileges allowed the unauthorized use of sensitive client information. This negligence in cybersecurity oversight violated TechFite’s obligations to safeguard client data, breaching the duty of due care owed to the company and its clients.</p>

<h2>SOX</h2>

<p>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) applies to TechFite because it is a publicly traded company that must maintain transparent and accurate financial reporting. In the case study, TechFite violated SOX by creating dummy corporations to manipulate sales figures, thus inflating the company's financial performance. Carl Jaspers and his associate Yu Lee were responsible for setting up these dummy companies, which resulted in fraudulent financial reports. SOX mandates that publicly traded companies like TechFite adhere to stringent auditing and financial control practices to ensure accurate reporting. TechFite's failure to audit these financial manipulations and prevent the creation of false sales reports is a direct violation of SOX, exposing the company to legal liabilities.</p>

<ins><b>Criminal Evidence, Activity, Actors and Victims</b></ins>

<p>In the case study, Carl Jaspers made Orange Leaf and Union City Electronic Ventures sign nondisclosure agreements (NDA) as a pre-consulting process. These documents contained information about their technical products. After the two companies denied business with TechFite's Application Division, their competitors launched similar products. It was then found out that two of the competitors were clients of TechFite's Application Division. Orange Leaf and Union City Electronic Ventures were the victims of criminal activity, as their sensitive information was accessed and potentially exposed to competitors.</p>

<p>A second instance of criminal activity involved the creation of dummy corporations to falsify TechFite's sales figures. Carl Jaspers and his associate Yu Lee created these dummy corporations to inflate TechFite's revenue artificially. The victims of this criminal activity were TechFite's shareholders and investors, who were misled by the fraudulent sales reports and manipulated financial data. The creation of these false corporations allowed TechFite to report its financial success, thereby violating financial laws falsely.</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity Policies & Procedures for Criminal Activity</h2>

<p>Implementing a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy would have helped prevent unauthorized access to sensitive client information. A DLP system monitors the flow of sensitive data within a company and prevents unauthorized access or transfer. If TechFite had enforced a DLP policy in the Application Division, the department's unauthorized attempts to access client data would have been detected and prevented. This policy could have stopped the unauthorized disclosure and misuse of sensitive information, thereby preventing criminal activity.</p>

<p>An Access Control policy, which enforces the principle of least privilege, could have prevented the BI Unit from accessing sensitive internal documents. This policy ensures that employees only have access to the data necessary for their specific job roles, limiting the potential for unauthorized access to protected systems. By enforcing this policy, TechFite could have restricted the BI Unit’s access to financial and legal documents, preventing the misuse of administrative privileges and avoiding the criminal activities that occurred.</p>

<h2>Evidence of Negligent Activity, Actors and Victim</h2>

<p>Carl Jaspers, TechFite's Application Division Head, was negligent by failing to safeguard sensitive client information within the BI Unit. There was no plan to separate client data, and the lack of a Chinese wall or least privilege policies gave all workstations full administrative rights. The marketing and sales unit also had unrestricted access to create, report, and post-sales without IT segmentation. This oversight allowed unauthorized access to client data, compromising the sensitive information of Orange Leaf Software and Union City Electronic Ventures.</p>

<p>TechFite's IT Security Analyst, Nadia Johnson, failed to audit the division's client list database. A review of this database revealed that while most clients were legitimate companies, three—Bebop Software, FGH Research Group, and Dazzling Comet Software—had no real internet presence. Further investigation showed these companies were all incorporated in Nevada and shared a registered agent, Yu Lee, a known associate of Carl Jaspers. Johnson's failure to detect and address these suspicious entries compromised TechFite's internal security. It contributed to potential reputational damage due to the inclusion of these questionable entities in the company's client base.</p>

<h2>Cybersecurity Policies & procedures for Negligent Activity</h2>

<p>TechFite could have addressed these negligent activities by implementing a Data Segregation Policy. This policy would ensure that sensitive client information is separated and protected using a Chinese wall methodology, preventing employees from accessing data beyond their role's scope. If this policy had been in place, Carl Jaspers' oversight in allowing full administrative rights across workstations and unrestricted access between the BI and marketing/sales units could have been prevented. This would have safeguarded the sensitive data of clients like Orange Leaf Software and Union City Electronic Ventures.</p>

<p>Additionally, an Auditing Policy could have required regular reviews of the client list database. Had this policy been enforced, Nadia Johnson would have been prompted to detect the suspicious entities—Bebop Software, FGH Research Group, and Dazzling Comet Software—before they could compromise TechFite's internal security. Audits could have identified these companies' questionable origins, preventing the reputational damage associated with including such entities in TechFite's client base.</p>

<h2>Legal Compliance Summary for Management</h2>

<p>TechFite is currently non-compliant with several critical laws. The company violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) by allowing unauthorized access to protected computer systems due to lax access control policies and inadequate account monitoring. TechFite also violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) by failing to prevent the unauthorized interception of electronic communications by the BI Unit. Lastly, TechFite violates the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) for fraudulent financial reporting by creating dummy corporations, which inflated the company’s sales figures. These compliance failures expose TechFite to legal risks and necessitate immediate action to improve internal controls, implement robust cybersecurity policies, and ensure transparent financial reporting to avoid further violations.</p>
